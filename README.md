# Garbage Classification using EfficientNetV2B2

This project uses *transfer learning* with the EfficientNetV2B2 model to classify garbage images into 6 categories:

- Cardboard
- Glass
- Metal
- Paper
- Plastic
- Trash

## 🔧 Technologies
- Python, TensorFlow, Keras
- Google Colab
- EfficientNetV2B2 (Pretrained)
- Matplotlib

## 📊 Dataset
- Kaggle Garbage Classification Dataset
- Images organized into folders for each class

## 📁 Files
- main.ipynb: Notebook with training and predictions
- garbage_classifier_efficientnetv2b2.h5: Trained model file
- requirements.txt: Dependencies (optional)

## 🧪 How to Use
1. Open main.ipynb in Google Colab
2. Upload test image
3. Run prediction cell to see class output

## 🔍 Sample Prediction
> Uploading an image of a plastic bottle returns: *"plastic"*
